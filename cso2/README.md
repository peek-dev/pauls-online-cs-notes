CS 3130 (Computer Systems and Organization 2, or "CSO2") is an upper-division undergraduate course at the University of Virginia, first offered in Spring 2023. The course is best described as a survey of the following topics:
* Operating systems: kernels; exceptions and signals; threads and processes; virtual memory; synchronization primitives
* Computer architecture: caches; pipelining; out-of-order (OOO) processors; side-channels and Spectre/Meltdown
* Computer networks: networking basics, TCP/IP, the OSI model
* Network security: cryptographic primitives, basic principles (symmetric/asymmetric encryption, etc.)
